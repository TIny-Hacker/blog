# Overview
Due to some privacy issues with having my email available to the general public, I've decided to change my main contact method to a Message on [Cemetech](https://cemetech.net). This means that when you click on the mail icon in the sidebar, rather than redirecting to my email, you will get a link to sending me a message on Cemetech. However, if you do not have a Cemetech account, this will require you to make one if you wish to get in touch with me. Also, please keep in mind that I may not view your message for a few days.
